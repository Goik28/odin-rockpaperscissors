This is supposed to be the revisited rock paper scissors game by the Odin project.

The objective of it was to create an UI for the game, playing by pressing buttons.
This lesson made me practice DOM manipulation, selecting document elements by ID or query selector.
I learned to create a branch in github, switch to it to work and merge it back, cleaning up the directory after.

I think this project is complete. It's not the prettiest but it works! =)
